            <h2>Profile</h2>
         
            <br><p>My name is Paolo Tindoc Malabayabas, 23 years old from San Pedro City Laguna.  
                <br>I graduated with Academic Distinction - Batch 2022 with the degree Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at San Pedro College of Business Administration. 
                <br>
                <br>I am a dedicated and soon to be a professional full stack web developer utilizing my hone skills in to the field. During my free time I study not only the tools need in this field but also the other programming languages.
                <br>During my first year in college, I have been chosen by our department to be the representative in JAVA Regional Programming Contest. Besides in Java, I also have skills and fundamentals
                <br>in other programming languages like C#, VB.net, Python and Php. I am a former IT Intern in a Construction firm in Valenzuela City which I was designated in Electrical Department were we worked more on utilizing google applications.
                <br>I also have fundamentals in Arduino which I can design and code a prototype. I have a knowledge in Cybersecurity which I interested with. I attended and participated several webinars in relation to my field.
                <br>I registered myself in an online bootcamp to hone the skills in HTML and CSS.
                <br>
                <br>Since I was a child, curiosity dominated in myself. I didn't give up to a thing if I am not satisfy about the answer that I discover or if I didn't try it. I believe the power of curiosity in myself that primitively flowing until now is what makes me who I am today. 
                <br>It brings myself to discover a different world then but now we can see it everywhere - the Technology. An impact to my past gives myself the opportunity to live with it until today and into the future.
                <br>Being in IT field was not easy but I choose to be a life long learner because that is a must in the field. Technology is not static, it is dynamic like every seconds, every minutes, and every single day it's evolving.
